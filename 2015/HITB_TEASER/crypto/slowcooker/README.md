# Hack In The Box Amsterdam CTF Teaser 2015: Slow Cooker

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 1000
**Description:** 

>While investigating potentially related incidents at civilian industrial facilities, we managed to capture suspicious traffic as it went from a food processing machine towards an internet connected IP camera. Although we successfully retrieved the program that was used to send the traffic, we were unable to salvage the sent file. We believe that [the file in question](challenge/slowcooker.tar.gz) contains one or more keys from the SKS. Your mission is to identify and exploit any weaknesses in the program and retrieve potential skeleton keys from the capture.
>
>Good luck, whoever - or whatever - created this abomination was clearly mad.
