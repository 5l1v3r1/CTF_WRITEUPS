# Hack In The Box Amsterdam CTF Teaser 2015: Pearl Diving

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 1000
**Description:** 

>Our division of foreign cyber affairs has been hard at work lately. While mapping out some obscure subnets (which we think belong to the intelligence agency that is investigating HEAVENWEB) we've come accross a Sattelite Communications Center. One of our employees managed to snag a copy of some [source code](challenge/frontend.tar.gz) before they further locked down the platform. Luckily the login frontend still seems to be [reachable](http://satcom.info/).
