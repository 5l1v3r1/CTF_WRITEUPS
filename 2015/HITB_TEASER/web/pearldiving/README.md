# Hack In The Box Amsterdam CTF Teaser 2015: Pearl Diving

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 1000
**Description:** 

>Our aquaculture department has been farming sea organisms of various kinds for the past few years now. Recently we've started branching out and instead of maintaining just our own aquafarms, we've started stealing fish and plants from other people their farms as well! (How naughty of us, eh?) Recently during a deep sea TCP scan we uncovered what we believe is the endpoint for an aquafarm maintenance system ran by TEAM GUMFISH. TEAM GUMFISH is well known for their cutting edge technologies when it comes to accumulating vast amounts of oysters. An excessive (and lame) nikto scan pointed out one accessible URI endpoint which can be found [here](http://52.16.114.54/cgi-bin/perl). However, so far we only seem to be getting "500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR" out of it.
