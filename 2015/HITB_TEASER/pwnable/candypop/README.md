# Hack In The Box Amsterdam CTF Teaser 2015: Candypop

**Category:** Pwnable
**Points:** 1000
**Description:** 

>We got backdoor access to an old candy vending machine, however we havent been able to escalate privileges to the underlying operating system yet. The candy machine is said to be using a strange obscure and minimal architecture. Can you help us get access? We need to get ahold of the copious amounts of KitKat & Snickers A.S.A.P.
>
>We conveniently made the backdoor accessible over TCP/IP, it can be reached at 52.16.33.218:22226. Furthermore, we managed to bribe an old employee of the manufacturer (that is now defunct) of the vending machine to send us a copy of a [binary](challenge/candypop).. but we can't make heads or tails out of it. HELP!
